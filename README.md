## Theory
In this problem we have to find the longest common prefix for given ‘n’ strings. We know that the common prefix for any two strings will be the  consecutive common character from the start of the strings. Here, the longest common prefix between two strings will be calculated by simply comparing the strings by iterating through them.

## Analysis
### Time Complexity
The algorithms were tested against positive random sets of variable sizes.The result thus obtained from this experiment is given below:

### Space Complexity
